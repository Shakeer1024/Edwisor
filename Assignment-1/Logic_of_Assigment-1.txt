->Write a function to take pokemon’s name as argument and display the information of that pokemon

======================================================================================================================================================================================================
1. Assign the given JSON data to a variable "pokemonData".

2. "pokemonData" is now an object where it contains key-value pairs.

3. "pokemon" is the only key present inside the "pokemonData" object, but it contains array of objects (key-value pairs) which are technically cosidered as values for the key "pokemon".

4. Declare a function "pokemonInfo" which takes pokemon name "pName" as an argument.

5. And then declare a boolean variable "isPokemonFound" as false.

6. Use for in loop to iterate the object "pokemonData" where here 'x' goes through each and every key inside pokemon array.

7. We are using "pokemonData.pokemon[x].name" inside "if" condition to compare the "name" key of all objects inside pokemon array, with the "pName" which we have given as an argument.

8. if the condition is successful in other words if the pokemon names matches.
 
     1. Then we are making "isPokemonFound" as true,

     2. and we are printing("pokemonData.pokemon[x]") details(complete object details) of that matched pokemon using console.log and

     3. we use "break" statement as we found the pokemon what we are looking for and in order not to iterate entire loop and  finally we will close the for loop.

9.  Now we use if-else condition again to check whether pokemon name found or not.

10. if "isPokemonFound" is false then we will print as " Pokemon Details doesn't exist" and if it is true we will print as "pokemon details found" and those details are in console.

11. Use prompt for getting pokemon name as input dynamically.

12. Finally we are calling the function "pokemonInfo".

->Write a function that takes pokemon’s name as an argument and find out which all pokemon have that name in their “next_evolution” field 
 
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================

1. Assign the given JSON data to a variable "pokemonData".

2. "pokemonData" is now an object where it contains key-value pairs.

3. "pokemon" is the only key present inside the "pokemonData" object, but it contains array of objects (key-value pairs) which are technically cosidered as values for the key "pokemon".

4. Declare a function "pokemonEvolutionInfo" which takes pokemon name "pName" as an argument.

5. Declare two boolean variables

    1. isPokemonFound=false -> it is used to check whether the pokemon which we give as an argument is exists or not.

    2. isEvolutionPokemonFound=false -> it is used in one of the if conditions.

6. Now the the first for loop and first if condition are used to check the pokemon's name with the given pokemon name i.e "pName", if it is found then we will make "isPokemonFound" as true. The code is same as first programme.

7. Now the second for in loop is used to iterate inside pokemon->"next_evolution" array and second "if" condition is to check the given pokemon name(pName) with the pokemon name present inside "next_evoution" field.

8. If we find the given "pName" in that pokemon "next_evoulution" field then we will make "isEvolutionPokemonFound" as true and we will print that "pokemon name" in which we matched the "next_evolution" pokemon name with "pName".

9. Now we will close the 2nd for in loop and then first for loop.

10. After the execution of for loops we will use if else statements to find out if the pokemon found or not.

11. if you enter the correct pokemon name then the boolean variable "isPokemonFound" will become true. if not then if condition executes and prints as "The pokemon details doesn't exist".

12. The second possible case is "isPokemonFound" = true and "isEvolutionPokemonFound" = false. The pokemon name you have given may be true but that pokemon is not found in the "next_evoution" field. then "else if" condition executes and

   prints as "the pokemon name  "pName" evolution is not found in any other pokemon list".
 
13. Then if both "isPokemonName" = true and "isEvolutionPokemonFound"= true then else part executes and prints as "the pokemon name  "pName" evolution is found in other pokemon list"

14. That's the end of the function.

15. Use prompt for getting pokemon name as input dynamically.

16. Finally we are calling the function "pokemonEvolutionInfo".

->Write a function that take a “Weakness” as an input and gives the names of all pokemon who have that Weakness. (check the weakness array in the dataset)

==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================


1. Assign the given JSON data to a variable "pokemonData".

2. "pokemonData" is now an object where it contains key-value pairs.

3. "pokemon" is the only key present inside the "pokemonData" object, but it contains array of objects (key-value pairs) which are technically cosidered as values for the key "pokemon"

4. Declare a function "pokemonWeaknessInfo" which takes pokemon weakness "pWeakness" as an argument.

5. Declare two boolean variables "isPWeaknessFound" = false.

6. Use for in loop to iterate the object "pokemonData" where here 'x' goes through each and every key inside pokemon array.

7. Now the second for in loop is used to iterate inside pokemon->"weaknesses" field array and "if" condition is to check the given pokemon weakness(pWeakness) with the pokemon weakness present inside the "weaknesses" array field.

8. If we find the given "pWeakness" in that pokemon "weaknesses" array field then we will make "isPweaknessFound" as true and we will print that pokemon name in which we matched the weakness in the "weaknesses" array field with "pWeakness".

9. Now we wil close the 2nd for in loop and then first for in loop.

10. After the execution of for in loops we will use to if else statements to find out if the pokemon weakness found or not.

11. if the "isPweaknessFound" is true then if condition executes and prints " pokemons with that weakness found " and you can see the list of pokemon's in the console.

12. if it is not found then else part executes and prints "No pokemons with that weakness found"

14. That's the end of the function.

15. Use prompt for getting pokemon weakness as input dynamically.

16. Finally we are calling the function "pokemonWeaknessInfo".
